for the first part i used a print and gave a welcome message and stored a random number
than i put a counter to track the tries used
after i opened a try and i gave the guess and the pick a number higher or lower
if the number there guessing is higher i said go lower if lower go higher
if they tried to use a random word other than a number it would send the message again
i did the same for both if it was above or below 10
each time a guess was entered i added a try to the counter
at the end i gave a print that said the guess they just entered was correct
i also gave the attempts it took them to do guess the answer correct than the game ends
